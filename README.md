## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

1. Initialize project as a public repository.
2. Looked through the design.
3. Structured content with HTML. 
4. Write out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Swiper JS


### What I learned

I learned some basic JS. and how to work with swiper. Also, how to implement the form in the website. The creation of hamburger menu was also the new thing to me. 

### Continued development

I still need to learn lots of JS basic rules and CSS grid. And how to simplify my code. 

### Useful resources

- Again, for making responsive websites (changing layout while expanding the screen etc.), I recommend Kevin Powell's videos.
